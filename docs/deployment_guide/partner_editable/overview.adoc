This Partner Solution deploys the JFrog software-as-a-service (SaaS) log collector on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. The log collector retrieves logs from your JFrog SaaS environment, parses them, and then forwards them to the Splunk data analytics platform.

The JFrog Platform uses its Cloud Log Collection function to collect standardized logs for all JFrog products and their services. Each log provides information about various use cases, including cloud usage, billing, and real-time system debugging. Once the Cloud Log Collection function collects the logs, they are stored in a dedicated JFrog Artifactory repository.
